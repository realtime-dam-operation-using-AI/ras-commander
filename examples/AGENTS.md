# Examples Notebook Contract

This file is the canonical local instruction file for `examples/`.

## Scope

- Parent guidance from the repository root `AGENTS.md` still applies.
- Notebooks are reference workflows for humans. Extract repeatable logic into scripts or library changes instead of leaving important automation only in notebooks.

## Notebook Workflow

1. Read code cells first. Ignore long outputs and images unless the task depends on them.
2. Understand the data flow and any environment-specific paths.
3. Extract useful logic into a script, CLI, or library change.
4. Execute derived scripts in a writable working folder such as `working/`.
5. Keep notebook modifications minimal and restore import cells to the standard committed state before finishing.

## Notebook Families

- `100s` - project initialization, plan operations, execution, callbacks
- `200s` - plain-text geometry parsing, structures, roughness, geometry authoring, calibration, and mesh workflows
- `300s` - unsteady flow files, DSS boundaries, HMS matching, terrain modifications, and boundary visualization
- `400s` - HDF geometry, hydraulic results, breach results, velocity profiles, and channel-capacity extraction
- `500s` - remote execution, Linux execution, and ModPuls result extraction
- `600s` - floodplain mapping, fluvial-pluvial delineation, and map-layer validation
- `700s` - sensitivity testing, benchmarking, Atlas 14, design storms, and precipitation workflows
- `800s` - QA and validation workflows
- `900s` - AORC, USGS, real-time forecasting, STOFS-3D, terrain, and operational workflows
- `950s` - FEMA eBFE model organization and validation
- `960s` - cloud-native export workflows

## Import Cell Convention

- Default committed state:
  - Cell 0 is markdown with an H1 title matching the notebook topic.
  - The first setup code cell keeps the active import/development toggle state used by that notebook.
- For local development testing, temporarily adjust setup toggles, then restore the committed state before finishing.

## Notebook-Only Logic

- If a notebook contains logic that should become a reusable API, call it out explicitly and extract it instead of duplicating it elsewhere.
- Examples already document some notebook-only patterns such as face aggregation, forecast-cycle loops, and specialized visualization helpers.

## Data And Outputs

- Do not commit extracted example datasets, heavy outputs, or ad hoc images.
- Small reference assets under `examples/data/` are read-only. Use root-level working folders for generated data.

## Where To Go Next

- Package code changes belong under [ras_commander/AGENTS.md](../ras_commander/AGENTS.md).
- Online example docs live under `docs/examples/`.
