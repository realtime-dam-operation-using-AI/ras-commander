RAS Commander is a Python library for automating HEC-RAS operations, providing a set of tools to interact with HEC-RAS project files, execute simulations, and manage project data. Within two years, CLB Engineering built the **most robust and feature-complete HEC-RAS and HEC-HMS automation solution on the open internet** using LLM Forward approaches -- proving that licensed professional engineers working alongside Large Language Models can create extraordinary value in compressed timeframes.

This library was initially conceptualized in the Australian Water School course "AI Tools for Modelling Innovation", and subsequently expanded to cover much of the basic functionality of the HECRASController COM32 interface using open-source python libraries and extend python tooling to the 6.x series of HEC-RAS. This library uses a Test Driven Development strategy, leveraging the publicly-available HEC-RAS Example projects to create repeatable demonstration examples. The "Commander" moniker is inspired by the "Command Line is All You Need" approach to HEC-RAS automation that was first implemented in the HEC-Commander Tools repository.

**March 2026 Update:** RAS Commander now supports a fully agentic engineering experience using CLI coding agents and agent SDK's to extend library functions and assist H&H engineers with common modeling tasks such as importing external data, performing QAQC reviews, validating project file paths, AEP and historic storm modeling, or any of the other functionality supported by, or imminently extendable from existing functions, in composable long form agentic workflows. Agents are instructed to work with humans in the loop: demonstrating their steps, maintaining modeling logs, and creating reproducible deliverables that can be externally verified directly in the HEC-RAS GUI. Long term memory is arranged in a hierarchical knowledge structure with progressive disclosure. Agents, skills, rules and cognitive memory systems are included to assist the user with solidifying LLM-written code into deterministic workflows in a continual learning loop, along with a file-based memory system to assist with long term task planning and execution across many conversations and subagents.

This library was developed using the **[LLM Forward](https://clbengineering.com/llm-forward)** approach -- a framework pioneered by [CLB Engineering Corporation](https://clbengineering.com/) for responsible adoption of Large Language Models in professional engineering practice. LLM Forward places professional responsibility first while positioning LLMs forward to accelerate insight and automation.

**Core Tenets:**
- **Professional Responsibility First** -- Public safety, ethics, and licensure remain paramount
- **LLMs Forward (Not First)** -- Technology accelerates engineering insight without replacing professional judgment
- **Multi-Level Verifiability** -- HEC-RAS GUI review + visual outputs + code audit trails
- **Human-in-the-Loop** -- Licensed professionals in responsible charge at all times

See [LLM Forward Development](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/llm-development/) for full philosophy and best practices.

## Don't Ask Me, Ask a GPT!

This repository has several methods of interaction with Large Language Models and LLM-Assisted Coding built right in:

1. **[Claude Code Agentic Infrastructure](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander/tree/main/.claude)**: A comprehensive cognitive infrastructure built for [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI tool. The `.claude/` directory contains specialized **agents**, **skills**, **rules**, and **commands**. Claude loads `CLAUDE.md`, which imports the shared `AGENTS.md` contract so Claude and Codex stay aligned.

2. **Codex Support**: Codex reads the canonical `AGENTS.md` hierarchy directly. Shared skills can be exposed through the generated `.agents/skills/` bridge without copying skill content. Claude Code and Codex are the production harnesses for this repository; other tools may still read the markdown context but are not the standard setup.

3. **[Full Documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://ras-commander.readthedocs.io/)**: Comprehensive API documentation, user guides, and example notebooks. Includes installation guide, quick start, and detailed class references.

4. **[RAS Commander Library Assistant on ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-TZRPR3oAO-ras-commander-library-assistant)** _(Deprecated - CLI agents preferred)_: This GPT is no longer actively maintained. For the best experience, use Claude Code or other CLI agents with the repository's built-in cognitive infrastructure.


## Background

The ras-commander library emerged from the initial test-bed of LLM Forward engineering represented by the [HEC-Commander tools](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/HEC-Commander) Python notebooks. These notebooks served as a proof of concept, demonstrating the value proposition of automating HEC-RAS operations through responsible LLM adoption.

In 2024, William Katzenmeyer taught a series of progressively more complex webinars demonstrating how to use simple prompting, example projects, and natural language instruction to effectively code HEC-RAS automation workflows, culminating in a 6-hour course. The library published for utilization in that course, [awsrastools](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/awsrastools), served as a foundation of examples which were iteratively extended into the full RAS-Commander library using LLM Forward development principles.

Unlike the original notebook by the same name, this library is not focused on parallel execution across multiple machines. Instead, it is focused on providing a general-purpose python API for interacting with HEC-RAS projects, and building an AI-friendly library that will allow new users to quickly scaffold their own workflows into a python script. Example notebooks are provided, but the intention is to empower engineers, software developers, GIS personnel and data analysts to more easily access and interact with HEC-RAS data in a python environment. Also, by publishing these examples publicly, with complete working code examples and LLM optimization, future users can readily rewrite the key functions of the library for inclusion into their own preferred libraries, languages or return formats.

## Features

If you've ever read the book "Breaking the HEC-RAS Code" by Chris Goodell, this library is intended to be an AI-coded, pythonic library that provides a modern alternative to the HECRASController API.  By leveraginging modern python features libraries such as pandas, geopandas and H5Py (favoring HDF data sources wherever practicable) this library builds functionality around HEC-RAS 6.2+ while maintaining as much forward compatibilty as possible with HEC-RAS 2025.

#### Work in a Local Copy

If you want to make revisions and work actively in your local version of ras-commander, just skip the pip install rascommander step above and clone a fork of the repo to your local machine using Git (ask ChatGPT if you need help).  Most of the notebooks and examples in this repo have a code segment similar to the one below, that works as long as the script is located in a first-level subfolder of the ras-commander repository:
```
# Flexible imports to allow for development without installation
try:
    # Try to import from the installed package
    from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasExamples, RasCmdr, RasPlan, RasGeo, RasUnsteady, RasUtils, ras
except ImportError:
    # If the import fails, add the parent directory to the Python path
    current_file = Path(__file__).resolve()
    parent_directory = current_file.parent.parent
    sys.path.append(str(parent_directory))
    # Alternately, you can just define a path sys.path.append(r"c:/path/to/rascommander/rascommander)")
    
    # Now try to import again
    from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasExamples, RasCmdr, RasPlan, RasGeo, RasUnsteady, RasUtils, ras
```
It is highly suggested to fork this repository before going this route, and using Git to manage your changes!  This allows any revisions to the ras-commander classes and functions to be actively edited and developed by end users. The folders "/workspace/, "/projects/", or "my_projects/" are included in the .gitignore, so users can place you custom scripts there for any project data they don't want to be tracked by git.

## Quick Start Guide

```
from ras_commander import init_ras_project, RasCmdr, RasPlan
```

### Initialize a project (single project)
```python
# Basic initialization using default HEC-RAS location (on C: drive)
init_ras_project(r"/path/to/project", "6.5")

# Specifying a custom path to Ras.exe (useful if HEC-RAS is not installed on C: drive)
init_ras_project(r"/path/to/project", r"D:/Programs/HEC/HEC-RAS/6.5/Ras.exe")
```

### Initialize a project (multiple projects)
```python
your_ras_project = RasPrj()
init_ras_project(r"/path/to/project", "6.5", ras_object=your_ras_project)
```

## Accessing Plan, Unsteady and Boundary Conditions Dataframes
Using the default 'ras" object, othewise substitute your_ras_project for muli-project scripts
```
print("\nPlan Files DataFrame:")
ras.plan_df
```
```
print("\nFlow Files DataFrame:")
ras.flow_df
```
```
print("\nUnsteady Flow Files DataFrame:")
ras.unsteady_df
```
```
print("\nGeometry Files DataFrame:")
ras.geom_df
```
```
print("\nBoundary Conditions DataFrame:")
ras.boundaries_df
```
```
print("\nHDF Entries DataFrame:")
ras.get_hdf_entries()
```



### Execute a single plan
```
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", dest_folder=r"/path/to/results", overwrite_dest=True)
```

### Execute plans in parallel
```
results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_number=["01", "02"],
    max_workers=2,
    num_cores=2,
    dest_folder=r"/path/to/results",
    overwrite_dest=True
)
```

### Modify a plan
```
RasPlan.set_geom("01", "02")
```

### Execution Modes

RAS Commander provides multiple methods for executing HEC-RAS plans:

#### Modern Command-Line Execution (HEC-RAS 6.0+)

**Single Plan Execution:**
```python
# Execute a single plan
success = RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", dest_folder=r"/path/to/results")
print(f"Plan execution {'successful' if success else 'failed'}")
```

**Sequential Execution of Multiple Plans:**
```python
# Execute multiple plans in sequence in a test folder
results = RasCmdr.compute_test_mode(
    plan_number=["01", "02", "03"],
    dest_folder_suffix="[Test]"
)
for plan, success in results.items():
    print(f"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}")
```

**Parallel Execution of Multiple Plans:**
```python
# Execute multiple plans concurrently
results = RasCmdr.compute_parallel(
    plan_number=["01", "02", "03"],
    max_workers=3,
    num_cores=2
)
for plan, success in results.items():
    print(f"Plan {plan}: {'Successful' if success else 'Failed'}")
```

**Smart Execution Skip** (NEW in v0.88.0):
```python
# Default: Smart skip - automatically skips if results are current
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01")  # Skips if HDF newer than inputs
# Logs: "Skipping plan 01: Results are current (HDF newer than inputs)"

# Force re-run even if current
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", force_rerun=True)  # Always executes

# Force complete geometry reprocessing
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", force_geompre=True)  # Clears .g##.hdf + .c##

# Efficiency: 10 plans, only 2 modified → 80% time savings
RasCmdr.compute_parallel(["01", ..., "10"])  # Runs only modified plans
```

#### Legacy COM Interface Execution (HEC-RAS 3.x-6.x)

**For older HEC-RAS versions**, use the RasControl class:

```python
# Initialize with version
init_ras_project(project_path, "4.1")  # or "41", "5.0.6", "506", "7.0", etc.

# Run a plan (auto-sets as current, blocks until complete)
success, messages = RasControl.run_plan("02")

# Extract steady state results
df_steady = RasControl.get_steady_results("02")
print(f"Extracted {len(df_steady)} rows with {df_steady['profile'].nunique()} profiles")

# Extract unsteady time series (includes "Max WS" special timestep)
df_unsteady = RasControl.get_unsteady_results("01", max_times=20)
times = RasControl.get_output_times("01")
```

**Key RasControl Features:**
- Uses plan numbers, not file paths (ras-commander style)
- Automatically sets current plan before operations
- Supports steady AND unsteady extraction
- Works with versions 3.1, 4.1, 5.0.x, 6.0, 6.3, 6.6
- Open-operate-close pattern (no HEC-RAS window left open)
- Perfect for version migration validation

### Working with Multiple Projects

RAS Commander allows working with multiple HEC-RAS projects simultaneously:

```python
# Initialize multiple projects
project1 = RasPrj()
init_ras_project(path1, "7.0", ras_object=project1)
project2 = RasPrj()
init_ras_project(path2, "7.0", ras_object=project2)

# Perform operations on each project
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", ras_object=project1, dest_folder=folder1)
RasCmdr.compute_plan("01", ras_object=project2, dest_folder=folder2)

# Compare results between projects
print(f"Project 1: {project1.project_name}")
print(f"Project 2: {project2.project_name}")

# Always specify the ras_object parameter when working with multiple projects
# to avoid confusion with the global 'ras' object
```

This is useful for comparing different river systems, running scenario analyses across multiple watersheds, or managing a suite of related models.

### Accessing HEC Examples through RasExamples

The `RasExamples` class provides functionality for quickly loading and managing HEC-RAS example projects. This is particularly useful for testing and development purposes.  All examples in the ras-commander repository currently utilize HEC example projects to provide fully running scripts and notebooks for end user testing, demonstration and adaption. 

Key features:
- Download and extract HEC-RAS example projects
- List available project categories and projects
- Extract specific projects for use
- Manage example project data efficiently

Example usage:
from ras_commander import RasExamples

```
categories = ras_examples.list_categories()
projects = ras_examples.list_projects("Steady Flow")
extracted_paths = ras_examples.extract_project(["Bald Eagle Creek", "Muncie"])
```

The RasExamples class is used to provide an alternative to traditional unit testing, with example notebooks doubling as tests and in-context examples for the end user.  This increases interpretability by LLM's, reducing hallucinations.  

### RasPrj

The `RasPrj` class is central to managing HEC-RAS projects within the ras-commander library. It handles project initialization, data loading, and provides access to project components.

Key features:
- Initialize HEC-RAS projects
- Load and manage project data (plans, geometries, flows, etc.)
- Provide easy access to project files and information

Note: While a global `ras` object is available for convenience, you can create multiple `RasPrj` instances to manage several projects simultaneously.

Example usage:
```
from ras_commander import RasPrj, init_ras_project
```

#### Using the global ras object
```
init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5")
```

#### Creating a custom RasPrj instance
```
custom_project = RasPrj()
init_ras_project("/path/to/another_project", "6.5", ras_instance=custom_project)
```

### RasHdf

The `RasHdf` class provides utilities for working with HDF files in HEC-RAS projects, enabling easy access to simulation results and model data.

Example usage:

```python
from ras_commander import RasHdf, init_ras_project, RasPrj

# Initialize project with a custom ras object
custom_ras = RasPrj()
init_ras_project("/path/to/project", "6.5", ras_instance=custom_ras)

# Get runtime data for a specific plan
plan_number = "01"
runtime_data = RasHdf.get_runtime_data(plan_number, ras_object=custom_ras)
print(runtime_data)
```
This class simplifies the process of extracting and analyzing data from HEC-RAS HDF output files, supporting tasks such as post-processing and result visualization.

#### Infrastructure Analysis
```python
from ras_commander import HdfPipe, HdfPump

# Analyze pipe network
pipe_network = HdfPipe.get_pipe_network(hdf_path)
conduits = HdfPipe.get_pipe_conduits(hdf_path)

# Analyze pump stations
pump_stations = HdfPump.get_pump_stations(hdf_path)
pump_performance = HdfPump.get_pump_station_summary(hdf_path)
```

#### Advanced Results Analysis
```python
from ras_commander import HdfResultsMesh

# Get maximum water surface and velocity
max_ws = HdfResultsMesh.get_mesh_max_ws(hdf_path)
max_vel = HdfResultsMesh.get_mesh_max_face_v(hdf_path)

# Visualize results
from ras_commander import HdfResultsPlot
HdfResultsPlot.plot_results_max_wsel(max_ws)
```

#### Fluvial-Pluvial Analysis
```python
from ras_commander import HdfFluvialPluvial

boundary = HdfFluvialPluvial.calculate_fluvial_pluvial_boundary(
    hdf_path,
    delta_t=12  # Time threshold in hours
)
```

## Acknowledgments

RAS Commander is based on the HEC-Commander project's "Command Line is All You Need" approach, leveraging the HEC-RAS command-line interface for automation. The initial development of this library was presented in the HEC-Commander Tools repository. In a 2024 Australian Water School webinar, Bill demonstrated the derivation of basic HEC-RAS automation functions from plain language instructions. Leveraging the previously developed code and LLM Coding tools, the library was created. The primary tools used for this initial development were Anthropic's Claude, GPT-4, Google's Gemini Experimental models, and the Cursor LLM-Assisted Coding IDE -- especially CLI tools such as Claude Code and Codex.

Additionally, we would like to acknowledge the following notable contributions and attributions for open source projects which significantly influenced the development of RAS Commander:

1. Contributions: Sean Micek's [`funkshuns`](https://github.com/openSourcerer9000/funkshuns), [`TXTure`](https://github.com/openSourcerer9000/TXTure), and [`RASmatazz`](https://github.com/openSourcerer9000/RASmatazz) libraries provided inspiration, code examples and utility functions which were adapted with LLM assistance for use in RAS Commander. Sean has also contributed heavily to 

- Development of additional HDF functions for detailed analysis and mapping of HEC-RAS results within the RasHdf class.
- Development of the prototype `RasCmdr` class for executing HEC-RAS simulations.

2. Attribution: The [`pyHMT2D`](https://github.com/psu-efd/pyHMT2D/) project by Xiaofeng Liu, which provided insights into HDF file handling methods for HEC-RAS outputs.  Many of the functions in the [Ras_2D_Data.py](https://github.com/psu-efd/pyHMT2D/blob/main/pyHMT2D/Hydraulic_Models_Data/RAS_2D/RAS_2D_Data.py) file were adapted with LLM assistance for use in RAS Commander.

3. Attribution: The [ffrd\rashdf'](https://github.com/fema-ffrd/rashdf) project by FEMA-FFRD (FEMA Future of Flood Risk Data) was incorporated, revised, adapted and extended in rascommander's RasHDF libaries (where noted). 

These acknowledgments recognize the contributions and inspirations that have helped shape RAS Commander, ensuring proper attribution for the ideas and code that have influenced its development.

5. [HEC-Commander Tools](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/HEC-Commander) - Inspiration and initial code base for the development of RAS Commander.

6. Attribution: Glenn Heistand's [`ras-agent`](https://github.com/gheistand/ras-agent) (CHAMP -- Illinois State Water Survey) -- an automated HEC-RAS pipeline that converts pour points into flood maps. The ras-agent pipeline's Linux execution patterns (`runner.py`), HDF results extraction (`results.py`), and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF rasterization directly informed the development of several ras-commander methods including `RasCmdr.compute_plan_linux()`, `HdfResultsMesh.get_mesh_max_depth()`, `HdfResultsMesh.export_max_depth_raster()`, `RasUtils.dos2unix()`, and `HdfBase.strip_results()`.

7. Attribution and Contribution: Gyan Basyal's [`pydsstools`](https://github.com/gyanz/pydsstools) and [`rivia`](https://github.com/gyanz/rivia) packages. Gyan's pydsstools was particularly influential in ras-commander's DSS handling approach -- its cross-version DSS6/DSS7 support philosophy, HEC epoch time conversion pattern, catalog-based lazy loading design, and TimeSeriesContainer wrapping informed the architecture of ras-commander's `RasDss` module. Gyan's rivia package is the source of the StoreAllMaps approach implemented in the ras-commander RasProcess module. 

8. Attribution: Michael Koohafkan's [`dssrip2`](https://github.com/mkoohafkan/dssrip2) -- an R package for reading and writing HEC-DSS files. The dssrip2 project's HEC Monolith JAR download and management approach was directly replicated in ras-commander's `_hec_monolith.py` module, including the Maven artifact specifications, platform-specific native library handling, and automatic download/cache strategy. This enabled ras-commander to provide a pure-Python DSS reading capability via the same Java bridge architecture that dssrip2 pioneered for R.
