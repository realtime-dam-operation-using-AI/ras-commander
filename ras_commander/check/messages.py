Message Catalog - Validation Message Templates for RasCheck.

This module provides message templates for all validation checks.
Each message has a unique ID, severity level, and parameterized text template.

Message ID Format:

Where:
- CHECK_TYPE: NT, XS, STRUCT (BR/CU/IW/ST), FW, MP
- CATEGORY: Two-letter category code
- NUMBER: Two-digit number (01-99)
- SUFFIX: Optional position indicator (L, R, S2, S3, etc.)
