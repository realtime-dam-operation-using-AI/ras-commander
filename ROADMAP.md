### Current Roadmap Tiers

1. **Near-term integration and stabilization**
   - Reconcile diverged branches, regionalize the land-classification starter
     values, remove documentation/index drift, and keep a ranked promotion
     queue from `feature_dev_notes/`
2. **Medium-term productization**
   - Clarify DataFrame-first execution behavior, strengthen docs, add tests
3. **Long-horizon feature development**
   - Build new capabilities not yet implemented anywhere in the repo

## Near-Term Integration and Stabilization

### 1. Calibration Branch Reconciliation

**Status**: Active  
**Branch**: `feat/ras-calibrate`

**Why this is first**:
- The branch is 5 commits ahead and 4 commits behind local `main` as of
  2026-04-12.
- `main` contains calibration-adjacent and eBFE/documentation changes that the
  branch does not have.
- The branch also carries notebooks and integration notes that should not be
  lost.

**Open work**:
- Rebase or replay `feat/ras-calibrate` onto current `main`
- Re-run notebooks `220` and `221`
- Resolve the `RasCalibrate` redesign vs revert split cleanly
- Confirm `depth_datum` behavior and `force_geompre` propagation
- Freeze the intended merge scope in `INTEGRATION.md`

**Exit criteria**:
- Branch is based on current `main`
- Notebook-backed validation passes
- Merge scope is explicit
- User-facing docs are aligned with the kept API

### 2. Monte Carlo Branch Integration

**Status**: Implemented on branch, not merged  
**Branch**: `feat/ras-montecarlo`

**Existing branch artifacts**:
- `d40032c9` - initial `RasMonteCarlo`
- `f052bb1d` - redesigned general-purpose uncertainty analysis
- `3b11f22e` - notebook `116_monte_carlo_uncertainty.ipynb`

**Open work**:
- Rebase/replay onto current `main`
- Verify `from ras_commander import RasMonteCarlo`
- Run notebook `116` against a real HEC-RAS project
- Capture merge-gate evidence before merge

**Exit criteria**:
- Branch imports cleanly on current `main`
- Notebook `116` runs end-to-end
- Merge evidence is archived

### 3. Floodway Branch Integration

**Status**: Implemented on branch, not merged  
**Branch**: `feat/floodway-analysis`

**Existing branch artifacts**:
- `db992a43` - Phase 1 floodway compliance checking
- `1a2394ae` - parametric surcharge limit + notebook
  `432_floodway_compliance_analysis.ipynb`

**Open work**:
- Rebase/replay onto current `main`
- Verify `RasFloodway` export/import behavior on the rebased branch
- Run notebook `432` with real HDF inputs
- Capture merge-gate evidence before merge

**Exit criteria**:
- Branch rebases cleanly
- Notebook `432` is verified on current code
- Merge evidence is archived

### 4. Documentation and Knowledge Index Sync

**Status**: Active

**Why it matters**:
- Agents and users are now more likely to be misdirected by stale docs than by
  unknown code.
- The docs site, `.claude` index layer, and root guidance files no longer
  match the live repository.

**Open work**:
- Sync `docs/notebooks/` and `mkdocs.yml` to the actual `examples/*.ipynb`
  inventory
- Remove generated docs for notebooks that no longer exist
- Fix root `AGENTS.md` references to missing top-level documents
- Update `.claude/skills/README.md`, `.claude/rules/README.md`, and
  `.claude/MANIFEST.md` to match the live skills/rules inventory
- Finish stale branch cleanup after the wine-fix merge

**Exit criteria**:
- Notebook docs and nav reflect only live notebooks
- `.claude` README/manifest indexes match the actual tree
- Root guidance points only to live files
- Merged/obsolete branches are cleaned up

### 5. Land Classification v1 Follow-On: Illinois Starter-Value
Regionalization for Continuous Infiltration Methods

**Status**: Active

**Why it matters**:
- `RasMap` land-classification work is now aimed at generating working
  `HDF/TIF` outputs, registering `.rasmap` layers, associating them to
  geometry, and recomputing preprocess tables without routing through
  `RasProcess.exe`.
- All three supported infiltration methods now receive provisional starter
  values, including first-pass defaults for `deficit_constant` and
  `green_ampt`.
- Official HEC-RAS docs provide parameter-estimation guidance, not built-in
  software defaults, so `ras-commander` needs an explicit starter-value
  strategy rather than waiting for HEC to populate those fields.
- For Illinois-first downstream workflows, a runnable model with reasonable
  initial values is more important than perfect first-pass physics because
  base overrides, geometry-specific calibration regions, and later
  calibration/validation are expected to replace those provisional values.

**Open work**:
- Replace the current heuristic provisional defaults with an Illinois-first
  starter-value strategy derived from USDA NRCS SSURGO/gSSURGO
- Use USDA NRCS SSURGO/gSSURGO as the primary numeric source, with Illinois
  regional/state layers used for QA and regional presets rather than as the
  primary per-cell assignment
- Keep the current explicit provisional defaults available as the fallback path
  when detailed Illinois mappings are unavailable or incomplete
- Route the starter-value profile through Glenn Heistand review and CHAMP
  review/input/ongoing coordination
- Document that these starter values are expected to be overridden later by
  base overrides, geometry-specific calibration regions, and
  calibration/validation work

**Exit criteria**:
- `add_infiltration_layer()` continues to write non-shell starter values for
  all three supported methods
- Illinois-specific SSURGO-driven mappings replace the current generic
  heuristics for `deficit_constant` and `green_ampt`
- Generated projects can be associated to geometry, recomputed, and run before
  detailed calibration
- Documentation clearly distinguishes provisional starter values from
  calibrated values
- The review/coordination path with Glenn Heistand and CHAMP is recorded

### 6. Feature Development Portfolio Promotion

**Status**: Active

**Why it matters**:
- `feature_dev_notes/` now contains a mix of branch-backed work, implementation
  specs, research corpora, and QA/reference folders.
- Without an explicit promotion queue, branch-ready work competes equally with
  scratchpads and historical studies.
- The immediate need is curation and promotion, not more top-level feature
  ideation.

**Current promotion queue**:
- `Calibration_Framework` -> `feat/ras-calibrate` rebase / scope freeze
- `Monte_Carlo_Uncertainty` -> `feat/ras-montecarlo` rebase / verification
- `floodway analysis` -> `feat/floodway-analysis` rebase / verification
- `LandCover_Soils_Pipeline` + `data-downloaders` -> Illinois-first land
  classification follow-on
- `HdfResultsQuery` -> next cross-cutting implementation-ready primitive
- `Issue_38_Geometry_2D_Writer` + `RasDecomp_meshgen` -> 2D geometry / mesh
  authoring foundation (mesh generation landed on `feat/headless-mesh`
  2026-04-22; geometry writer remains open)
- `examples/123_rasmapper_geometry_layer_updates.ipynb` -> RASMapper geometry
  layer update validation suite; wait for terrain-modification authoring
  functions before adding terrain-driven mutations, but add the plain-text
  cross-section bank-station mutation/validation test as the first
  non-terrain proof case

**Open work**:
- Keep `feature_dev_notes/README.md` and `feature_dev_notes/ROADMAP.md` as the
  live local index rather than relying on older snapshot files
- Convert top local candidates into explicit backlog items with dependencies and
  effort estimates
- Demote QA/reference/archive folders from the strategic roadmap surface

**Exit criteria**:
- The top local feature folders are ranked and mapped to concrete backlog items
- Root roadmap surfaces active promotion candidates, not legacy portfolio noise
- Historical/spec-only folders are no longer treated as equal-priority delivery
  work

### 7. HDF Results Parity with RasControl / HECRASController

**Status**: High priority, implementation-ready

**Why it matters**:
- `RasControl` and the legacy HECRASController surface more result variables than
  the current `HdfResults*` readers expose.
- Recent reference-line QAQC work showed that the plan HDF can already contain
  additional native 2D reference-line variables such as `Area`, `Top Width`,
  `Friction Slope`, and `Depth Hydraulic`, but the current HDF extractors do not
  read them consistently.
- This is a relatively easy win compared to brand-new feature development:
  most of the work is expanding extractor allow-lists, harmonizing schemas, and
  adding notebook/test coverage.
- For 2D workflows, this parity work should be paired with a separate but
  complementary geometry-side effort to expose stage-dependent cell/face
  property tables and derived hydraulic properties more directly.

**Open work**:
- Audit `RasControl` result readers against `HdfResultsPlan`, `HdfResultsMesh`,
  `HdfResultsXsec`, and related HDF extractors
- Expand `HdfResultsXsec` to read all native reference-line variables present in
  the HDF group when available, not just `Flow`, `Velocity`, and
  `Water Surface`
- Apply the same parity principle across 1D cross sections, 2D meshes,
  structures, and reference points/lines so HDF-backed extraction is the
  default modern path
- Prefer robust dataset discovery / optional loading over brittle hard-coded
  minimal variable lists
- Add tests and notebook coverage proving that HDF extraction returns the same
  major result families that `RasControl` can already access
- Document where HDF results now reach parity with `RasControl`, and where
  geometry-derived enrichments (for example face conveyance from property
  tables) remain a separate layer

**Immediate acceptance targets**:
- Native 2D reference-line readers expose `Area`, `Top Width`,
  `Friction Slope`, `Depth Hydraulic`, and other present variables
- Native reference-line velocity can be validated directly from HDF outputs
  such as `Flow / Area` where applicable
- `HdfResults*` coverage is explicitly tracked against `RasControl` /
  HECRASController output families rather than grown ad hoc

## Medium-Term Productization

### 1. DataFrame-First Execution Clarity

**Status**: Planned

The next architecture pass should make execution behavior easier to reason
about and easier to teach.

**Open work**:
- Audit `compute_plan`, `compute_parallel`, `compute_test_mode`, and
  `compute_parallel_remote`
- Document when `plan_df` and `results_df` refresh automatically vs when the
  caller must refresh or re-query
- Confirm there is no remaining folder-path drift after the `[Computed]`
  default removal and the 2026-04-10 alias/geompre fixes
- Audit example notebooks for glob/path anti-patterns

**Potential follow-on**:
- Add a DataFrame navigator agent or skill for answering:
  - where HDF results live
  - how geometry and boundary metadata are exposed
  - what the major DataFrames/GeoDataFrames contain

### 2. eBFE Public Catalog Documentation

**Status**: Planned

The repo now has enough research to document the public BLE/eBFE discovery
path, but the knowledge is not yet packaged for normal users.

**Open work**:
- Turn `.claude/outputs/calibration-research/2026-04-10-ble-s3-research.md`
  into user-facing docs
- Align `.claude/skills/ebfe_crawl_s3-catalog/SKILL.md` with the validated
  discovery workflow
- Add a discoverability section to `docs/ebfe_models.md`
- Clarify how study enumeration works when bucket listing is unavailable

### 3. RASMapper Results, Stored Maps, and Spatial Review Integration

**Status**: Planned

The RASMapper automation surface has grown from separate efforts:
stored-map creation/export helpers, calculated-map setup, map/reference layer
registration, result-layer visibility controls, CurrentView/screenshot
packaging, and RASMapper QA/QC review bundles. These should be integrated into
one discoverable workflow family instead of remaining as parallel function
groups.

**Open work**:
- Audit existing stored-map creation functions, including `RasMap.store_all_maps()`,
  `RasMap.postprocess_stored_maps()`, calculated-layer helpers, and any
  RasProcess-backed stored-map wrappers
- Align those APIs with `RasMap.list_result_layers()` and
  `RasMap.set_result_layer_visibility()` so users can create/store maps and
  then control the corresponding RASMapper result layers for figures and QA/QC
- Add a high-level recipe that can: create or refresh stored result maps, select
  the desired result/map/terrain/geometry layers, set `CurrentView`, enable
  update-legend-with-view, open standalone RASMapper, and capture a screenshot
- Keep low-level functions available, but document the recommended public
  orchestration path for normal workflows
- Extend the RASMapper spatial review notebook to show at least one stored-map
  generation path feeding into result-layer visibility and screenshot capture

**Exit criteria**:
- Stored-map creation and RASMapper result-layer presentation are documented as
  one coherent workflow family
- Example notebooks demonstrate both low-level primitives and the recommended
  high-level orchestration path
- Result-layer naming/selection is validated against real projects before and
  after stored-map generation

### 4. Test and Notebook Hardening

**Status**: Planned

**Open work**:
- Add an integration test covering all four HMS-derived precipitation methods
- Add DSS direct-write coverage in the precipitation workflow docs/notebooks
- Add parallel execution examples where that improves real workflows
- Return to `examples/123_rasmapper_geometry_layer_updates.ipynb` and extend
  the proof cells from "operation ran and artifacts changed" to "known local
  geometry/terrain mutation propagated into the target RASMapper element."
  Most cases depend on the parallel terrain-modification branch; before that
  lands, mutate `Bank Sta=` values in the plain-text geometry and validate the
  updated `Left Bank` / `Right Bank` fields in
  `Geometry/Cross Sections/Attributes` after the RASMapper cross-section update.
  Proposed mutation-backed tests:
  - Cross-section bank stations from plain-text `Bank Sta=` edits, as the
    immediate unblocked test.
  - Cross-section terrain profile updates for all points, channel-only, and
    overbanks-only once terrain mutation helpers land.
  - XS interpolation surface TIN updates after a localized terrain change
    between selected cross sections.
  - Storage area elevation-volume curves after terrain edits inside selected
    storage-area polygons.
  - SA/2D connection from/to and terrain profile updates after terrain edits
    along the connection centerline.
  - Bridge/culvert, inline structure, and lateral structure river-station and
    terrain-profile updates after localized terrain/profile-line changes.
  - Edge-line creation after deterministic XS/bank-line or terrain-triggered
    geometry changes.
  - Blocked-obstruction updates and generated obstruction polygons after
    controlled obstruction/terrain context changes.
  Acceptance: every live demo has a mutation cell, GUI update cell, read-back
  validation cell, and before/after figures where applicable.

## Long-Horizon Feature Development

These items are still genuine roadmap work. They are not implemented on the
current branch or on known feature branches.

### 1. 1D Benefit Areas Analysis

**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: Medium

**Goal**:
Extend benefit-area analysis to 1D cross-section models, not just 2D mesh
results.

**Current state**:
- 2D mesh benefit areas already exist via
  `HdfBenefitAreas.identify_benefit_areas()`
- 1D cross-section benefit areas do not yet exist

**Likely API direction**:

```python
HdfBenefitAreas.identify_benefit_areas_1d(
    existing_hdf_path,
    proposed_hdf_path,
    min_delta=0.1,
    interpolation_method="linear",
    ras_object=None,
)
```

**Key design problems**:
- Converting line-based cross sections into reviewable polygons
- Aggregating contiguous reaches into benefit/rise segments
- Handling mixed 1D/2D projects without confusing the sign conventions

**Dependencies**:
- `HdfResultsXsec`
- `HdfXsec`
- A clear interpolation/polygonization strategy

**Success criteria**:
- Reach-level benefit/rise outputs are reviewable in GIS
- Sign convention matches the existing 2D benefit-area workflow
- Mixed-model behavior is explicit and documented

### 2. Atlas 14 Gridded AEP Events for HEC-RAS

**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: Medium

**Goal**:
Create a direct gridded Atlas 14 design-storm path for HEC-RAS using the same
kind of NetCDF workflow that already exists for AORC.

**Current state**:
- Atlas 14 depth-grid extraction exists
- AORC gridded precipitation workflows exist
- No direct Atlas 14 gridded export path exists for HEC-RAS design storms

**Planned approach**:
1. Extract Atlas 14 depth grids for the project extent
2. Apply a temporal distribution such as `Atlas14Storm` or `FrequencyStorm`
3. Write NetCDF in a HEC-RAS-compatible gridded precipitation structure
4. Configure the unsteady boundary via `RasUnsteady.set_gridded_precipitation`

**Explicit non-goals**:
- Do not revive placeholder hydrograph-to-gridded conversion helpers
- Keep this as a direct gridded-design-storm workflow

**Success criteria**:
- End-to-end notebook-backed demonstration with a real model
- Output structure matches the proven AORC pathway
- Documentation clearly distinguishes hyetograph vs gridded workflows

### 3. Automated Lateral BC Creation from USGS Gauge Locations

**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: Medium-High

**Goal**:
Automate creation of SA/2D lateral boundary conditions near tributary gauges
for multi-gauge validation workflows.

**Motivating use case**:
- Notebook `915` style validation setups with several tributary inflows
- Reduce manual HEC-RAS geometry editing for lateral inflow creation

**Likely API direction**:

```python
RasGeometry2D.create_lateral_bc_from_gauge(
    geom_file,
    gauge_id,
    gauge_lat,
    gauge_lon,
    num_faces=20,
    offset_distance=50.0,
    trim_percent=7.5,
    bc_name=None,
    add_to_unsteady=False,
    unsteady_file=None,
    validate_geometry=True,
    ras_object=None,
)
```

**Implementation phases**:
1. Extract and query external mesh faces
2. Convert candidate faces into a continuous boundary line
3. Offset and trim the line safely
4. Write the geometry-file SA/2D connection entry
5. Optionally wire the boundary into the unsteady file
6. Validate in GUI and notebook workflows

**Key technical challenges**:
- Ordering faces into a continuous line
- Determining the correct outward offset direction
- Preserving HEC-RAS fixed-width geometry formatting
- Ensuring the generated connection is valid and external to the mesh
- Handling CRS/unit conversions correctly

**Success criteria**:
- A valid SA/2D connection can be created from gauge coordinates quickly
- The result loads in HEC-RAS without geometry errors
- Multi-gauge validation setup becomes minutes instead of hours

### 4. 2D Mesh Face / Breakline Alignment QA

**Status**: Proposed
**Priority**: Medium-High

**Goal**:
Create a quantitative QA/QC tool for mesh alignment along breaklines,
structures, and SA/2D connections.

**Motivating use case**:
- SA/2D connections and roadway breaklines often look close in plan view but
  have adjacent mesh faces that are offset enough to change hydraulic behavior
- Narrow roads or levees can have steep terrain gradients, so small horizontal
  offsets can create large vertical profile errors
- Wider roadway embankments can tolerate larger horizontal offsets, so the
  score should account for feature width and terrain context rather than using a
  single global tolerance

**Likely API direction**:

```python
HdfMeshQuality.score_breakline_alignment(
    geometry_hdf_path,
    breakline_name=None,
    structure_name=None,
    horizontal_tolerance=5.0,
    vertical_tolerance=0.25,
    width_field=None,
    terrain_hdf_path=None,
)
```

**Scoring dimensions**:
- Horizontal distance from the intended breakline/structure alignment to the
  adjacent mesh cell faces
- Longitudinal profile divergence between the intended breakline profile and
  the profile sampled along the adjacent mesh faces
- Context-sensitive tolerance adjustment for narrow roads, wide embankments,
  levees, and high-gradient terrain
- Per-feature score, flagged station ranges, and review geometries suitable for
  RASMapper screenshots or GIS export

**Explicit non-goals**:
- Do not change meshing behavior in the first pass
- Do not rely on visual screenshots alone; screenshots should support a
  numerical score and extracted diagnostic geometry

**Success criteria**:
- Misaligned SA/2D connections and breaklines are detectable without manual map
  inspection
- The score identifies both horizontal offset risk and vertical profile risk
- Outputs can drive RASMapper layer/view automation for documentation snapshots

## Roadmap Hygiene Rules

- If work is already implemented, remove it from the future roadmap and record
  it in `agent_tasks/.agent/PROGRESS.md` instead.
- If work exists only on a branch, classify it as integration/verification
  work, not as greenfield feature work.
- Keep `ROADMAP.md` aligned with `agent_tasks/.agent/BACKLOG.md`; the roadmap
  should summarize direction, while the backlog should track execution detail.
