# Development Gate: Merge-to-Main Policy

**Policy**: ALL development happens on feature branches. `main` is production-only. Direct pushes to `main` are never allowed.

This policy was established to prevent incomplete work from reaching the production branch. It applies universally — no exceptions without explicit user confirmation.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this skill when you detect any of:
- User says "merge", "push to main", "commit to main", "PR to main"
- Current branch appears to be `main` and user wants to commit
- `git push origin main` is about to be run
- A PR target is set to `main` without a feature branch in the chain

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Current Branch

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on `main`**: Stop immediately — explain the policy and offer to create a feature branch.

**If on a feature branch**: Verify the merge direction (feature → main via PR, not direct push).

### Step 2: If on Main — Recover

```bash
# Create feature branch from current state
git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]

# Verify uncommitted changes moved with you
git status

# Optionally stash and reapply if needed
git stash
git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]
git stash pop
```

### Step 3: Gate Check Before Any Push to Main

Before running `git push origin main` or creating a PR to main, verify:

| Check | Command | Pass Condition |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Not on main | `git branch --show-current` | Output ≠ "main" |
| Tests pass | `pytest` or project test command | 0 failures |
| No uncommitted changes | `git status` | "nothing to commit" |
| Feature branch exists | `git log --oneline main..HEAD` | At least 1 commit ahead |

### Step 4: Correct Merge Path

```
feature/my-work → PR → main    ✅ Correct
feature/my-work → direct push to main  ❌ Blocked
main → direct commit  ❌ Blocked
```

**Creating the PR**:
```bash
git push origin feature/my-work
gh pr create --base main --head feature/my-work --title "..." --body "..."
```

### Step 5: Hotfix Exception

Hotfixes may go directly to main **only** with:
1. Explicit user statement: "this is a hotfix"
2. User confirmation: "I understand this bypasses the feature branch policy"
3. A same-day revert plan if needed

Even then: prefer `hotfix/[name]` branch → PR → main.

## Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/[ticket-or-description]    ← new features
bugfix/[description]               ← bug fixes
hotfix/[description]               ← production emergencies only
refactor/[description]             ← refactoring passes
experiment/[description]           ← exploratory work
```

## What to Say When Intercepting

If user attempts a direct-to-main operation:

> "⚠️ You're about to [operation] directly to `main`. The ras-commander workflow requires all changes go through feature branches → PR → main.
>
> Want me to:
> 1. Create a feature branch from your current state?
> 2. Help you open a PR from your existing feature branch?
> 3. Proceed anyway (hotfix only — requires your confirmation)?"
