"""
Remove [Computed] folder workaround code from notebooks.

This script removes the obsolete workaround code that was needed before v0.88.1
when compute_parallel() and compute_test_mode() created separate [Computed] and [Test] folders.

After v0.88.1, results are consolidated directly to the original project folder,
so the workaround is no longer needed.
